# EVER Starter Template - Web Client

> Starter template for a new EVER project - React frontend in TypeScript to access an on-chain contract

## Overview

This project is an inependent reserch in Everscale Blockchain by young programmers. It consists of:

- Web frontend for interacting with the dapp from a web browser (this repo)
- Smart contract based on Solidity syntax
- Telegram bot for interacting with the dapp from inside Telegram messenger (coming soon)

## What does this repo contain?

- `src/pages/*.tsx` - The different pages in your app website (top level non-reusable components)
- `src/components/*.tsx` - Reusable React components usually for populating pages with special content
- `src/contracts/*.ts` - .sol, .abi.json, .tvc files
- `src/helpers/*.ts` - Project agnostic general purpose helpers that will cut some of your boilerplate
- `src/hooks/*.ts` - Custom React [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) implementations
- `src/translations/*.json` - Static textual content (copy) in various languages
- `public/*.*` - Static site assets (like images, HTML files) that will be copied as-is when publishing

- Support only EVER Wallet
- Based on React library - probably the most popular frontend library for simple declarative UI
- No fancy state management - simple React hooks without libraries like redux or mobx
- Built for Github Pages - the best place to host your open source dapp for free and allow users to fork it
- Material UI - relies on [MUI](https://mui.com/), probably the most popular UI library for JavaScript

## Dependencies and requirements

To setup your local machine for development, please make sure you have the following:

- A modern version of Node.js
  - Installation instructions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Run in terminal `node -v` to verify your installation, the project was tested on `v17.3.0`
- A decent IDE with TypeScript support
  - We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once your local machine is ready, install the project:

- Git clone the repo locally and rename the directory to your own project name
- In the root repo dir, run in terminal `npm install`

### or.. work 100% online instead

Alternatively, you can ignore the above requirements and develop right inside a web browser with an online IDE and _zero_ setup. Simply open this repo inside [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) without installing anything:

- Create your new Glitch workspace by opening [this link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/clone-from-repo?&REPO_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fton-defi-org%2Ftonstarter-webclient.git) in your browser
- Wait about 40 seconds until installation completes <br>(click the "LOGS" button on the bottom of the IDE to see progress)
- Edit your source files in the `src` directory in the online IDE
- To run terminal commands like `npm run build` click the "TERMINAL" button on the bottom of the online IDE
- Working online is slow! run on a local machine if you want a much faster experience

## Development instructions

- Write code

  - Everything is in the `src/**/*` directory
    - Top-level pages in `src/pages/*.tsx`
    - Adapters to all integrated FunC contracts in `src/contracts/*.ts`
  - To run app in development mode, run in terminal `npm start`
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

- Build

  - In the root repo dir, run in terminal `npm run build`
  - Website will be generated and minified in the `docs` directory

- Deploy
  - Make sure Github Pages is enabled in your repo settings
    - In Github: Settings > Pages > Select branch = `main`, Select folder = `/docs`
    - You can also define a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
  - Deploy built site to Github Pages
    - Simple git push, the `docs` directory contains your website content
